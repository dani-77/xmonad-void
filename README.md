# xmonad_install script

Bash script ready to install XMonad on your Void GNU/Linux X86_64 machine.

# xmonad_install

A basic XMonad install, without any extras;

It installs all needed dependencies and programs to make my usual XMonad config work;
it installs a session xmonad file in /usr/share/xsessions, a Wallpaper and my xmonad and xmobar configs.

To use it simply:

```
./xmonad_install
```

and wait a few time (cabal installing XMonad and all needed libs takes a long time).

In both cases have your superuser pass at hand; you will need it.

Have fun
